"""End-to-end tier A: synthetic camera, scripted hand, simulated arm.

This is the milestone-1 exit criterion expressed as a test. It runs the
real threads, the real IK and the real safety layer, and asserts on the
properties that make the loop trustworthy rather than merely running:
no IK failures, no safety-guard hits, a control loop that keeps time, and
an end-to-end latency in a sane range.

Everything here is timing-sensitive, so bounds are deliberately loose
enough to survive a loaded CI machine while still catching a regression
of the kind found during bring-up (a mock camera running 30x too fast,
which pushed loop jitter to 70 ms).
